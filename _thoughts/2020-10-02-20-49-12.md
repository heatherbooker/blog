Why I'm not impressed when people are pleased they use phyiscal force and intimidation to make their dog behave: (think: dominance theory, cesar millan..)

Do you think you could physically force and/or intimidate this creature into behaving?! i doubt it. :joy:

The beginning is cool, and at 37 seconds is even better. (The end is blurry photos, just fyi.)

Train with kindness and empathy, and science. :) Then you can train anything from chickens to polar bears!
