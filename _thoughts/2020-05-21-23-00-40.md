The beginning of thoughts

There is a super cool thing a friend of mine did, which I wish to emulate: have an adorable [page of random thoughts](https://glit.sh/~wesleyac/thoughts/). It seems super low pressure, fun as a reader to get a glimpse into someone else's head, and fun as a creator to just collect a mish-mash of glorious tidbits.

The [original implementation](https://github.com/marenbeam/thoughts) shows how to do it if you have a specific website setup, or something, I don't know, I was too lazy to figure it out. :joy: So first I did a [most lazy version](/2020/05/19/random-thoughts.html); turns out that doing the lazy version was enough to motivate me to do the real version! Cool. Here we are. :)
