Humans love stories.

Inspo:
1. [BS medicine podcast](https://therapeuticseducation.org/bs-medicine-podcast) said it in an episode. I forget the context. Something about how people believe silly stuff as long as there's a nice story to carry the silliness.
2. Something else happened in here. I forget.
3. [Indigenous studies course from University of Alberta/Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/indigenous-canada) starts with a story about turtle island, which you live on. (Amazing course so far, I totally recommend it! My friend invited me to join him in taking it, and I'm so glad.)
