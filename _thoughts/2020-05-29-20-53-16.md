have you ever considered that all of life could just be an experiment? like "i wonder what will happen if i date this person" and "will it be good to squeeze an entire lemon into this salad?" and "i hypothesize that sharing this thought will have little-to-no impact on my life". the end result is rather irrelevant; it just means you learned a thing. or a different thing. how nice!
