I find it nice to have role models. People around me who make my life nicer, and other people's lives nicer, and then I try to think: how can I be more like them? And what would make them think I am a good person?
Then I do nice things like:
- Smile kindly at mistakes
- Forgive more easily
- Use diplomatic language
- Help others
- Be positive and curious

So, if you are my role model, keep being great :)
Do you have role models, dear reader?
