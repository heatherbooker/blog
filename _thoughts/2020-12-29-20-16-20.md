on writing opera (being a _librettist_): "Something I’ve learned from other librettists who are well-accomplished in writing things to be sung: if you can shout it, you can sing it. That’s a good test, if you want to run around your room shouting things to see how they come out." —Charles Wuorinen

i imagined myself doing this and ...it sounds fun. :joy:
