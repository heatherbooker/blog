I updated my blog from jekyll to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/)! I had constant battles with jekyll to build my blog, my ruby installation is dysfunctional, whatever whatever. I wanted a js based framework to make my static site and 11ty / Eleventy is pretty cool! I still have a big ol to do list but most of the work is done and now I will finally be able to write blog posts and publish thoughts again. YAY. : )
