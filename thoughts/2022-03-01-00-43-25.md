Sometimes I feel a vague discomfort, or even a burning rage, in certain situations, yet I have great difficulty putting my feelings or rationale for my feelings into words. Then someone else puts it into words, and it makes me happy. Or at least relieved. I feel that they have released my pent-up frustration, by explaining _why_ such-and-such-a-thing was so upsetting.

Some recent instances:
- a tiktok polyamory joke that went something like:
  (poly person): hey, do you want to go on a date sometime?
  (other person): i'm actually in a monogamous relationship, i'm here with my girlfriend
  (poly person): ooh, so you _and_ your girlfriend?
  , and someone's comment saying "well i thought it was pretty obviously a no"
  , and another commenter asking "how so?"
  , and the response __"because it wasn't a yes"__

- [a blog post about unwelcome body comments](https://www.girlonthenet.com/blog/my-body-dont-like-it-dont-fuck-it/)
  , which dictates the appropriateness of physical assessments from intimate partners
  , but frankly life in general would be better if everyone thought twice

- a moment in [Tuca and Bertie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuca_%27_Bertie) where:
  Bertie's coworker comments on her breasts
  , subsequently a sexual harrassment seminar is held
  , wherein Bertie announces why the comments were unacceptable:
  "you made me think about my own body at work! that's DISGUSTING!"
