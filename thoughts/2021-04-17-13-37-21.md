I have to give meds to a rat in a syringe and I spent the first day trying to restrain the rat and force the syringe into its mouth. After two very squirmy, unpleasant attempts (unpleasant for me, probably terrifying and horrible for the rat :( ), I thought "There has _got_ to be a better way." So I asked the internet, which delivered [the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrvhBTOa-kw) - put the meds in food, duh. Just make yourself a delicious tiny plate of: oatmeal, ketchup, watered-down peanut butter, mashed whatever, a single cheerio...the options are endless (don't poison your rat tho), empty the syringe onto the plate and mix it up (or let the cheerio absorb it up!), and give it to your lil chubster in the cage where they will feel comfortable eating it. DUH. I feel so stupid for not having tried that. I'm sorry baby rat!! But now we have a better way! That makes us both happy - baby rat climbs all over the plate because he is so eager to eat his treat :joy:, and I get to watch him being happy and silly. :heart_eyes:
