I tried to start writing another post but vim is back to its old habits of appearing to insert weeeeeiiiiiird characters as I type.

It does this from time to time...I must have messed with some config somewhere. Anyway, PLZ HALP, AM NEED HALP. 

I believe it has to do with the character encoding or colours for my shell or something. I am also suspicious that it might have happened when I uninstalled jedi-vim. 

It's funny because the other day I was typing and I hardly noticed the weird visual corruption, which made me think of when Rose at RC  said  having a Linux system hasn't led to an improvement in her ability to solve problems with the OS; instead, her tolerance for living with things being screwed up has increased. I think that is definitely sometimes true. I will go through phases of tolerating-to-the-point-of-not-noticing glaring flaws in my setup, and then desparately trying to fix whatever it is. This has included:  

- when I broke my Windows partition
- my computer freezing when plugged into an external display
- the mouse being clicked randomly all over the screen whenever the laptop lid was closed
- so many things with vim
- I don't even know  

It's an interesting life. I like the challenges that come along with using Linux. Without them, there are 1001 things I would never have learned. Maybe closer to 1,000,001 things.
