    <p>
      <p>There is a super cool thing a friend of mine did, which I wish to emulate: have an adorable <a href="https://glit.sh/~wesleyac/thoughts/">page of random thoughts</a>. It seems super low pressure, fun as a reader to get a glimpse into someone else's head, and fun as a creator to just collect a mish-mash of glorious tidbits.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/marenbeam/thoughts">original implementation</a> doesn't involve any manual git-anythings, and makes a nice separate page for these random thoughts. However, I (apparently) am never going to get around to doing that, so a blog post that I update with the thoughts seems good enough. It will be weird, but I am fine with that. :D</p>

    <p>
      <p>I have some sense that I should be sequestering the &quot;sex&quot; posts in some corner of their own, behind a wall that readers have to click &quot;YES I LIKE READING ABOUT SEX&quot; to access. As if to protect them for the horrifying content within. And the more I think about how to do it, the more confused I get. And I think the reality is that I shouldn't do that. The sex posts get to live merrily alongside the code posts and the whatever-else-I-decide-to-write about posts, because they're all part of me, and they're all part of life, and I want to share them all. I am not into this idea of censoring myself; the internet, of all places, is a place to be free, I would say. Certainly enough people seem to use it that way. :joy: So why shouldn't I?</p>

      <p>The title: so overused but so good.</p>
<p>So I want to talk about sex. I think the world needs more frank conversation around Real Life™. Topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>anxiety</li>
<li>sadness</li>
<li>loneliness</li>
<li>pooping</li>
<li>sex</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Wow, that list was a trip Heather&quot; you might be saying. &quot;Anxiety and pooping in the same list?!&quot; You know what though? Anxiety definitely makes me poop. Just saying. Now you know. Sorry not sorry. If this were a non-static site (ie, a site that could count button clicks), I would add a button with a counter so you, dear reader, could click-participate: &quot;ME TOO&quot;. As it is, I'll just imagine you feeling relieved that someone else admitted it before you.</p>

      <p>So, this post was drafted years (no, <em>literally</em> years) ago when I was applying to Outreachy, and it just stayed a draft forever because I guess I thought there was more to it. It turns out, there wasn't, because if there was, it would be there. Ha! I still think it's interesting though, and I want it out of my &quot;untracked files&quot; when I run <code>git status</code>*, so here it comes, in all its overdue glory. ;)</p>

    <p>
      <p>Why I don't feel like a programmer:</p>
<p><strong>I use a mac at work</strong></p>
<p>Real programmers don't like Apple.
Real programmers embrace all the manual dirty work they have to do configuring and trouble shooting basic functions on this or that linux distro.
I just want shit to work.</p>
<p><strong>I use package managers</strong></p>
<p>Mac has homebrew.
At home on Fedora, I just use the software manager GUI. If I want something not through it, I have to look up instructions. I don't even know what my package manager is.</p>

<p>I am struck by a strange dichotomy of phenomenons that I find in tech job mentalities.</p>
<p>One goes a little like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You've been there 9 months and you're not looking for a new job?! Why not?!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the contrary goes like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, this place is good. I can seek out what I need within my company and I am well supported here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you identify with one or the other mentality. Certainly I found myself happily settling into my workplace, grateful for the autonomy and influence I was given, grateful for the people I worked with, grateful for interesting challenges without undue pressure and unachievable deadlines.</p>
