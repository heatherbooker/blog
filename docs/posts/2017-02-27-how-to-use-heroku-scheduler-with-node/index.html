  <article class="post-content">
    <p>While there are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13956024">multiple</a> <a href="http://www.spacjer.com/blog/2014/02/10/defining-node-dot-js-task-for-heroku-scheduler/">tutorials</a> out there on using the Heroku Scheduling add-on with Node.js, they all seem to suggest the same strange series of steps. I can't understand why they all recommend</p>
<ul>
<li>putting your scheduled task in a file without an extension...</li>
<li>in a directory called 'bin', and...</li>
<li>executing it without specifying <code>node</code> in the command, but instead adding <code>#!/path/to/node</code> to the top of the task file.</li>
</ul>
<p>I originally didn't look at any of these tutorials - I guessed from the examples using other languages in the <a href="">Heroku docs</a> that I could just write a normal <code>javascriptfile.js</code> and execute it by running <code>heroku run node javascriptfile.js</code>.</p>
<p>However, Heroku also asserts that you should be able to test your task by running <code>heroku run my task</code> locally, but every time I tried this, it would fail with the following error:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"></code></pre>
<p>Wait, hold on just one cott'n pickin' secon'. I just went to run it so I could dutifully copy the <em>exact</em> error message for y'all, and it ran WITHOUT GLITCHES. wAT?!??</p>
<p>Well. My only proposed explanation is that all the times I ran this in the past, I either</p>
<ol>
<li>hadn't added, committed, and pushed the file to Heroku, or</li>
<li>hadn't waited long enough after adding, committing, and pushing to Heroku for it to be available.</li>
</ol>
<p>Idk if that last one makes any sense. But I swear it has to be something like that, because after reading a tutorial that (said I should be able to do it the way I <a href="http://www.modeo.co/blog/2015/1/8/heroku-scheduler-with-nodejs-tutorial">was doing it</a>, plus) specified adding and committing and pushing the file before trying to <code>heroku run</code> it, I definitely made sure I had done that.</p>
<p>Anyway, where I <em>was</em> going with this was to say that it kept claiming it couldn't find the <code>javascriptfile.js</code> that I was telling it to run. Because my task wouldn't necessarily output anything every time it ran, I simply added an extra line  so it would email me every time the file was executed. I also added a similar line to the sibling file that I had copied into the /bin dir and removed the .js from and added the path/to/node to, plus a comment telling me which was which.</p>
<p>My Heroku scheduled tasks now looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/img/heroku-scheduler.png" alt="'node task.js' and 'task'"></p>
<p>I gratefully soon received an email from my task! It was from the file I had originally included - the one that made structural sense to me. Phew. Maybe I do understand things after all.</p>
<p>Now I wait to see if the other file will also send me an email! I hope the suspense doesn't kill me. If it doesn't, I'll just delete it. If it does, I'll delete it anyway.* Teehee - it's all for <strong>science</strong>!</p>
<p>* I'll delete it anyway because I don't need two files for one task, and I wanna keep the one I came up with all on my own! <img src="/img/heart-emoji.png" alt="heart eyes face"></p>
