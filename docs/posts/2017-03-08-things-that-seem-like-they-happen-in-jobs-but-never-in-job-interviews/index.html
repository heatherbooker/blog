  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Maybe it's just because I've been setting up wackloads of dev environments and picking projects, but this whole <em>Prepping for <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy">Outreachy</a></em> business is making me think that there's a lot more to jobs than all these job interviews involving little code challenges get at.  There's a baloney-ton of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talking to people</li>
<li>Figuring out what to work on</li>
<li>Stalking channels on IRC</li>
</ul>
<p>Nah, actually I guess this stuff is probably pretty specific to my current situation. (The last one was kindof a joke, except it's definitely true.) I am also spending a ton of time waiting, for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tests to run</li>
<li>Setup scripts to run / Installs + Downloads to finish</li>
</ul>
<p>like sometimes more than an hour. What! Never in my life have I waited so long for anything.* I guess I sortof also wait for</p>
<ul>
<li>Answers on how to proceed / Help</li>
<li>PR approval / Feedback</li>
<li>Conversations to happen on IRC that I can stealthily glean information from</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully once I am more involved in the community and more informed about proper processes and procedures, I will feel less of a need to do that last one.</p>
<p>Anyway, it just feels like I do a lot of &quot;meta&quot; tasks, and less actual &quot;programming&quot; tasks lately. To counter that, I've also been trying to throw a few <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/heatherbooker">HackerRanks</a> in to keep myself sharp. When I can ignore the hair-rip-out-inducing input forms of these HackerRanks, they are pretty fun lil thangs! I remember some people at RC raving about how addicting they are, and now that I spend all day job hunting (sort-of), they certainly are a tasty treat...I can very much see how one might wind up not wanting to walk away.</p>
<p>Another note - my monitoring of IRC is not good for me. It's like when online-checkins started at RC; I see what everyone else is doing, and how they're interacting with others, and I get sad that I'm not doing that. Let's look at some possible solutions (gee, I hope these fancy new markdown tables I just learned how to build render into HTML (did I use the word 'render' gramatically there?)).</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Solution</th>
<th>Pros</th>
<th>Cons</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Don't lurk on IRC.</td>
<td>Wait, why does this column exist. The pro of all of these is obvi to not get sad.</td>
<td>FOMO! Miss out on: helping people, seeing other people be helped, gossip, internal decision making, bugs, feature and product discussion</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Participate</td>
<td>Ah this has a bonus pro of obtaining more information and potentially making contacts!</td>
<td>May annoy/burden people, takes time, must constantly check because I can't figure out how to get notified, have to pick 0) channel and 1) topic and 2) words</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>My biggest concern with participating more is that these people already spend a lot of their time managing wannabe contributors and I want to be independent and only ask for help when necessary. At the end of the day, it's probably just like most things - there is no right answer. Just <em>whatever</em>.</p>
<p>This post has rambled. I'm out.</p>
<hr>
<p>* It is definitely a lie that I have never waited more than an hour for anything. Things I have waited more than an hour for include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flights (to get on)</li>
<li>Flights (for other people to get off)</li>
<li>Bedtime</li>
<li>Dancing</li>
<li>Mail</li>
</ul>
<p>However - when I wrote that, I was reminded of the thought that &quot;Never in my life have I worked so hard for anything.&quot;, which is how I feel about programming. This probably deserves to be an article on its own, but it's a truth - never in my life have I worked so hard for anything as I have to learn to code. This is a fact that continues to awe me. Stay tuned for further notes on this matter.</p>
