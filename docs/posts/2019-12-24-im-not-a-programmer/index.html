  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Why I don't feel like a programmer:</p>
<p><strong>I use a mac at work</strong></p>
<p>Real programmers don't like Apple.<br>
Real programmers embrace all the manual dirty work they have to do configuring and trouble shooting basic functions on this or that linux distro.<br>
I just want shit to work.</p>
<p><strong>I use package managers</strong></p>
<p>Mac has homebrew.<br>
At home on Fedora, I just use the software manager GUI. If I want something not through it, I have to look up instructions. I don't even know what my package manager is.</p>
<p><strong>I use my mouse</strong></p>
<p>Real programmers only use the keyboard.<br>
Also, they can type without looking.<br>
Not me.</p>
<p><strong>I forget how to use FZF in vim every time my manager shows me</strong></p>
<p>ctrl + p. ctrl + p. This time I'll remember.</p>
<p><strong>I don't know how to write a bash script</strong></p>
<p>Did you know bash doesn't have types? An int and a string are the same thing. What does that even mean? Idk.</p>
<p><strong>Or an awk script</strong></p>
<p>I can't process files fast. Wouldn't that be fun? My coworker is going to make a text editing mini war for us all. Bet I won't succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Or use that JSON processing thing</strong></p>
<p>Like you pipe JSON into it and process it and get answers. In goes JSON, out comes object.key[2]. This was a problem when I wanted to find out if our users ever request a certain field from one of our GraphQL endpoints - I needed to process a lot of logfile. Which reminds me,</p>
<p><strong>I have to copy pasta and double check the steps every time to 1) SSH, or 2) deploy</strong></p>
<p><code>scp</code> is an alien concept. And every other tool that Julia Evans has a cute cartoon explaining. I don't know the syntax or the rules and I'm scared to screw anything up. Maybe that's a good thing, on second thought. At least in some ways.</p>
<p><strong>Or know how to set up a server</strong></p>
<p>It has to like, connect to the internet or something right? And have some software running on it? At least an OS? An operating system counts as software right?</p>
<p><strong>Or know how to explain what a server is</strong></p>
<p>I asked my friend if the software her company uses is just for them, or available for anyone to use. She said, &quot;It's on a server...whatever that means.&quot;. I said, yeah I don't know - a computer that does stuff? Maybe without you? Then her roommate explained like a textbook: a server is a specialized computer that whatever whatever I don't know I don't remember, I was busy being sad that I didn't really know what a server was.</p>
<p><strong>I've never managed my own memory</strong></p>
<p>I don't know how a computer works. There's memory and nands and ands and ors and nors. I've never used C or C++ or C# or C- or C%.</p>
<p><strong>I prefer doing to planning</strong></p>
<p>I don't want to think through every possible outcome and option, I just want to make stuff.<br>
That's too waterfall-y. But it means I run up against lots of impossible solutions, and spend time trying plan A then ditching in favour of plan B then returning to plan A. Seems like a waste of time. I'm scatterbrained.</p>
<p><strong>I prefer doing to reading</strong></p>
<p>I don't want to read through the whole React docs every time there's an update, I just want to make stuff.</p>
<p><strong>I don't care much about history</strong></p>
<p>Who is Luna Lovegood? I mean Eva Rotwell? I mean...the girl? The famous one? Who wrote a program, or maybe she didn't?</p>
<p><strong>I use google services</strong></p>
<p>And skype, and whatsapp, and I have a facebook account - multiple facebook accounts.<br>
Real programmers are wary of that stuff.<br>
Real programmers use discord, and signal, and tox, and the onion, and tor, and maybe the onion is actually just the logo for tor, and..?</p>
<p><strong>I'm just a web developer.</strong></p>
<p>I'm just a front end developer.<br>
I don't have an engineering degree.</p>
<p><strong>But I'm a web developer who can't even do CSS.</strong></p>
<p>Isn't that, like, all web developers are good for? CSS?</p>
<p><strong>I don't need long chunks of uninterrupted time.</strong></p>
<p>Real programmers get in a state of flow.<br>
Real programmers need quiet and space to produce genius inventions. I just make forms. No genius required.<br>
I have no right to complain about noise or interruptions.</p>
<p><strong>I don't play video games.</strong></p>
<p>Ack! They all play video games. And chess. And ping pong. I'm an alien! They play chess because they focus and get in flow state and analyse...just like the last point.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>That's better</strong></p>
<p>Anyway, I feel a bit better now. I can still be a programmer if all of the above is true. I'm not static (I can still learn things). I can't learn everything at once (and I'm still fresh enough in programming - 4 years isn't a very long time!) I am just me and I can use my strengths of curiousity and desire to make nice things ‚ù§Ô∏è And that's enough!</p>
<p>Buhbye now.</p>
<p>PS - Don't forget to be nice to your less nerdy co-workers. Don't show surprise when they could be about to have a learning opportunity. Make them feel welcome and valued no matter their background and methods. In short, be kind to one another. üòÉ ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
<p>PPS - I picked up a couple <a href="https://adventofcode.com">advent of code</a> puzzles, because I thought that might be a fun way to feel a little bit more like a programmer again. I think it's working. üòÉ</p>
<p>PPPS - Did you forget the first PS already? Go back to it! üòâ</p>
