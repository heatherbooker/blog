  <article class="post-content">
    <p>&quot;Con't&quot; is how I used to abbreviate &quot;continued&quot; when I took notes in HS/uni. The good old days. I could never use my laptop even in university (ie when I had one) to take notes in class because the instant I would get even remotely disinterested, I would be totally gone and only tune back in to be hella confused. Dis bad.</p>
<p>Anyway, since deciding that continuing to explore &amp; contribute to Mozilla would be better than trying to (frantically, because that's apparently the <em>only</em> way) apply for other jobs, I have found myself much happier.</p>
<p>Today I set up <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker">Docker</a>!  Holy smokes finally the time has come! It always gets mentioned - even when I told Stanley I wanted to work on Blaggregator (RC's internal blog aggregator...don't you love that name!), he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, talk about a piece of cake! I added a Dockerfile when I was contributing so now it should be super easy to set up!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bah humbug, I thought. Well, that's not quite true. I was just surprised that he thought that made it easier. I thought that made it harder - now I had to set up Docker <em>and</em> the actual code. Docker just always seemed like this magical, elusive technology that advanced devs used, and I couldn't justify taking time to explore it myself because I never really <em>needed</em> it.</p>
<p>Also, I think I like to do things the hard way. Sometimes. Sometimes I am trigger happy and I <code>apt-get install</code> like a..whatever, similies are hard. But then I balance that out by sometimes doing everything I can to avoid installing dependencies. For example, I would like to check out BMO, or <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a>, Mozilla's bug tracker. I first tried just getting it running. Then I relented and turned to Docker, though still resisted using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/">docker-compose</a>, a Docker container management tool. I sleuthed enough to figure out that the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file contained some tidbits of tasty info, of which I (perhaps erroneously? I still don't know) decided the only important bits were this:</p>
<pre class="language-yml"><code class="language-yml">    <span class="token key atrule">ports</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br>      <span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token string">"80:80"</span><br>      <span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token string">"5900:5900"</span></code></pre>
<p>Ah! This means I must bind the port on my machine (host!) to that on the container. I also decided 5900 was the only important one to bind...probably not true, in retrospect. However, the way I tried to get around this was to amend my command to run the container:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Original:</span><br><span class="token punctuation">(</span>sudo<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token function">docker</span> run bmo-dev<br><br><span class="token comment"># New attempt:</span><br><span class="token punctuation">(</span>sudo<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token function">docker</span> run -p<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">127.0</span>.0.1:5900:5900 bmo-dev</code></pre>
<p>I tried a few other syntaxes (syntacies?) but nothing seemed to be available in my browser ðŸ˜¢ so I resorted to installing docker-compose.</p>
<p>Also, I aliased <code>docker</code> to <code>sudo docker</code> because it always needs to be run with root privledges and ain't nobody got time to type sudo every time. I decided this is sufficiently innocuous. Please educate me if I am wrong. Also by &quot;time to type&quot; I mean &quot;brain power to remember to type&quot; and &quot;experience to understand that the error message has nothing to do with debugging docker and everything to do with needing MOAR POWER.&quot;.</p>
<p>Things I'm learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Perl, <code>$</code> identifies a scalar variable (string, num) while <code>@</code> identifies an array</li>
<li><code>127.0.0.1</code> is the magical built-in-to-my-computer Apache server!</li>
<li>Patience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune in next time to find out moar things about Mozilla and Outreachy! And maybe life! I talked to a couple mentors lately about their projects and it is making me super excited at the prospect of being fully involved in them! ðŸ˜ƒ)</p>
