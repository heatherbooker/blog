<p>I find it nice to have role models. People around me who make my life nicer, and other people's lives nicer, and then I try to think: how can I be more like them? And what would make them think I am a good person?<br>
Then I do nice things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smile kindly at mistakes</li>
<li>Forgive more easily</li>
<li>Use diplomatic language</li>
<li>Help others</li>
<li>Be positive and curious<br>
❤️<br>
So, if you are my role model, keep being great 😃<br>
Do you have role models, dear reader?</li>
</ul>
