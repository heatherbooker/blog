<p>The beginning of thoughts</p>
<p>There is a super cool thing a friend of mine did, which I wish to emulate: have an adorable <a href="https://glit.sh/~wesleyac/thoughts/">page of random thoughts</a>. It seems super low pressure, fun as a reader to get a glimpse into someone else's head, and fun as a creator to just collect a mish-mash of glorious tidbits.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/marenbeam/thoughts">original implementation</a> shows how to do it if you have a specific website setup, or something, I don't know, I was too lazy to figure it out. ðŸ˜‚ So first I did a <a href="/posts/2020-05-19-random-thoughts">most lazy version</a>; turns out that doing the lazy version was enough to motivate me to do the real version! Cool. Here we are. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
