<p>I love the idea of food parties, where there shall be a theme, and all participants may contribute to variants on the theme. My ideas have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>plant milk party: i bake chocolate chip cookies and everyone brings a different non-dairy milk for sampling. because there are so many! like havernut i mean hazelnut, and pea, and yumm. of course, i bake the cookies because they must be standardized in order to properly pit the milks against each other without confounding variables. ðŸ˜Ž</li>
<li>ice cream sundae partae: this should take place on a sunday. because there is nothing more important when planning a party than to maximize puns before even beginning. guests bring a topping of their desiring, like chocolate sauce and bananas and cherries and pecans and brownies. the problem with this party is that i only want vegan ice cream which is eXPENsive. maybe i can get an ice cream machine and then make my own... ðŸ˜Ž</li>
<li>sushi party: i, the esteemed host, prepare sushi rice and nori for rolling, while the hungry invitÃ©s bring their preferred vegan sushi ingreds. (sorry, i am not down for flopping a bunch of dead fish around my house. ðŸ˜œ) then, we have an adventure attempting to roll and slice the aforementioned components into..i suppose into maki rounds (rolled up) or sushi blobs (oblong blobs of rice with a topping draped delicately over them).</li>
<li>ramen party: inspired by a dear friend who missed a particular brand of indonesian instant noodles[^1] and suddenly chanced upon them while in the wonderful city that is NYC, he bought a billion packages to share and we all happily slurped up our noodles. this plan was originally stymied by my lack of sufficiently high-sided bowls. but if i had the bowls i wanted, party peeps could bring corn and green onions and tofu and greens. ramen party memory reminds me of:</li>
<li>salad factory: an ingenius invention of a person who came before me, wherein all participants bring various salad components - nuts, dressings, leafies, fruits.. - and each member mixes and matches to their heart's content. i adore this because salad needs too many ingredients and to be too fresh for me alone to be bothered to eat many of them.</li>
<li>hot pot party: my latest dream, based out of an inability to ever go out for hot pot due to my avoidance of meat. i dream of a beautiful spiced broth bubbling on my stove, with plates of greens and mushrooms and tofu puffs. apparently i can maybe even find vegan fish puffs?! see, i do have the significant obstacle of not having any hot surface to maintain the hot pot hot on, but a girl can dream. and dream she does.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since no food parties (or other parties) may occur until the post-covid era, I am free to cook up (heh heh) ideas of any proportions. Also since no parties may occur, I am free to be as enthusiastic as I want about hosting them, all while experiencing none of the dread and anxiety that accompany actually doing so. I get anxious about hosting parties because I want everything to be perfect because if everything is perfect then people will like me and if people like me then I will feel temporarily relieved. (I have decided it is a good idea to fully verbalize the explanations for any unfortunate aka nonsense-and-self-defeating mental habits I may have, so that I may see how nonsensical they are, and eventually let go of them. Ah see, it feels less constricting already. ðŸ˜ƒ )</p>

So, what do you think? Don't those all sound so fun and appealing?! <em>drooling</em> See you at the party!</p>

[^1]: While I was verifying the country of origin of said noodles (Indonesia is correct! The brand is called IndoMie.) my friend reminded me that I had been especially enthousiastic about these noodles because they were slightly limey which I apparently loved. This is not a particularly strong memory for me, but it is most believeable, as lime is delicious. I think I was more excited though about what it meant for someone to buy a batch of something they loved, something that was meaningful to them, to share with people, in an act of love. Feeding people is an act of love! And I think in many cultures it is central to community, but as a white north american, I group up just thinking that food is food, and my food is my food, and your food is your food. I am more of a hoarder than a giver by nature and I am always struck by people's generosity in moments like this. I would have bought all the noodles and eaten one a day. Or just bought two packs of noodles instead of 25, and not shared at all. And so I treasure learning opportunities where I can realize that I could give instead of hoarding!! ðŸ˜‰ Wow this footnote is like a blog post in itself. ðŸ˜‚</p>
