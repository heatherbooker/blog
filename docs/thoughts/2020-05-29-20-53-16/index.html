<p>have you ever considered that all of life could just be an experiment? like &quot;i wonder what will happen if i date this person&quot; and &quot;will it be good to squeeze an entire lemon into this salad?&quot; and &quot;i hypothesize that sharing this thought will have little-to-no impact on my life&quot;. the end result is rather irrelevant; it just means you learned a thing. or a different thing. how nice!</p>
