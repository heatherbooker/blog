Sometimes I feel a vague discomfort, or even a burning rage, in certain situations, yet I have great difficulty putting my feelings or rationale for my feelings into words. Then someone else puts it into words, and it makes me happy. Or at least relieved. I feel that they have released my pent-up frustration, by explaining <em>why</em> such-and-such-a-thing was so upsetting.</p>

Some recent instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a tiktok polyamory joke that went something like:<br>
(poly person): hey, do you want to go on a date sometime?<br>
(other person): i'm actually in a monogamous relationship, i'm here with my girlfriend<br>
(poly person): ooh, so you <em>and</em> your girlfriend?<br>
, and someone's comment saying &quot;well i thought it was pretty obviously a no&quot;<br>
, and another commenter asking &quot;how so?&quot;<br>
, and the response <strong>&quot;because it wasn't a yes&quot;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.girlonthenet.com/blog/my-body-dont-like-it-dont-fuck-it/">a blog post about unwelcome body comments</a><br>
, which dictates the appropriateness of physical assessments from intimate partners<br>
, but frankly life in general would be better if everyone thought twice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a moment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuca_%27_Bertie">Tuca and Bertie</a> where:<br>
Bertie's coworker comments on her breasts<br>
, subsequently a sexual harrassment seminar is held<br>
, wherein Bertie announces why the comments were unacceptable:<br>
&quot;you made me think about my own body at work! that's DISGUSTING!&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
