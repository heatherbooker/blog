<li><a href="https://therapeuticseducation.org/bs-medicine-podcast">BS medicine podcast</a> said it in an episode. I forget the context. Something about how people believe silly stuff as long as there's a nice story to carry the silliness.</li>
<li>Something else happened in here. I forget.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/indigenous-canada">Indigenous studies course from University of Alberta/Coursera</a> starts with a story about turtle island, which you live on. (Amazing course so far, I totally recommend it! My friend invited me to join him in taking it, and I'm so glad.)</li>
