There is a super cool thing a friend of mine did, which I wish to emulate: have an adorable [page of random thoughts](https://glit.sh/~wesleyac/thoughts/). It seems super low pressure, fun as a reader to get a glimpse into someone else's head, and fun as a creator to just collect a mish-mash of glorious tidbits.

The [original implementation](https://github.com/marenbeam/thoughts) doesn't involve any manual git-anythings, and makes a nice separate page for these random thoughts. However, I (apparently) am never going to get around to doing that, so a blog post that I update with the thoughts seems good enough. It will be weird, but I am fine with that. :D

First thought is this hilarious ad on a website for a local music store that I thought was very cute and saved a few weeks ago, for this exact purpose:

![steves music store - wash those hands!]({{ '/assets/img/steves.png' | relative_url }})

I think this format will not do; it is going to make me censor myself more, because this feels like a conversational blog post rather than a collection of random thoughts. But we must try anyway.

I am a parasite to humanity.
